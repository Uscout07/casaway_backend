# Email Setup Guide for Casaway Backend

This guide explains how to set up email functionality for password reset and other email notifications in the Casaway backend.

## üìß Email Service Overview

The email service uses **Nodemailer** to send emails through SMTP. It's currently configured for:
- Password reset emails with verification tokens
- Professional HTML email templates
- Fallback text-only emails

## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Choose Your Email Provider

#### Option A: Gmail (Recommended for Development)
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Generate an "App Password":
   - Go to Security ‚Üí App passwords
   - Select "Mail" and your device
   - Copy the generated 16-character password

#### Option B: Outlook/Hotmail
- Use your regular email and password
- No additional setup required

#### Option C: Custom SMTP Server
- Contact your email provider for SMTP settings

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add these variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

### 3. Test the Configuration

The email service will automatically verify the connection when the server starts. Check the console logs for:
- ‚úÖ "Email service is ready" - Configuration is correct
- ‚ùå "Email service configuration error" - Check your credentials
